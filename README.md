# xbee-node-client
This is our gateway part of project. we collect data from [XBEE Nodes](https://github.com/Water-Leak-Detectors/XBEE-nodes) and by using python [xbee module](https://github.com/niolabs/python-xbee) we handle recieved packets. we are using [ThingsBoard iot platform](https://github.com/thingsboard/thingsboard/) you need to install this platform on your sever, also don't forget to install neccessary packages on your gateway which for us is RaspberryPI3.
